# coresearch
 .NET Core in-memory simple full text search library

Coresearch uses an inverted index with a boosted trie data structure for indexing atomic search criterion from content to resources. Trie algorithm makes Coresearch more elastic and allows both exact word querying and operations like fuzzy search, wildcards and character matching. Entire trie structure is stored in memory for better performance. The entire project was written as a learning project so be aware of putting in on the production ðŸ˜‰
