# coresearch
 .NET Core in-memory simple full text search library

Coresearch uses an inverted index with a boosted trie data structure for indexing parts of information from content to resources (pieces of data to resource meta information). Trie algorithm makes Coresearch more elastic and allows both exact word querying and operations like fuzzy search, wildcards and character matching. Entire prefix trie is stored in memory for better performance. The entire project was written as a learning project so be aware of putting in on the production ðŸ˜‰
